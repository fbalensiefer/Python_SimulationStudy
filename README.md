# Student-Project by Fabian Balensiefer
## Replication Study: *"Are Credit Markets Still Local? Evidence from Bank Branch Closings"* by Hoai-Luu Q. Nguzen

The scope of this project is to replicate the major findings from the paper mentioned above by using *Python* as Data Science tool. 
Additionally, I will try to test for overrepresentation within the sample using *Resampling* techniques.  

**Already done:**
-	Set up class room
-	Summarize paper findings
-	Prepare causal graph Tex
-	Get in touch with the data
-	Reproducing summary stats
-   Replication of Figures and Main regression-tables (work in progress)

**To Do:**
-	Check how to implement higher dimensional FE (group_timeID & indivID) and clustering on clustID
-   Check how to put SE in brackets below
-   Implement 2SLS-IV and check generated POST-Variables 
-   Why does the normalized Figures look different? 
-	Apply bootstrap/ resampling to test for overrepresentation
-	Check causal graph and identification
