# Student-Project by Fabian Balensiefer
## Replication Study: *"Are Credit Markets Still Local? Evidence from Bank Branch Closings"* by Hoai-Luu Q. Nguzen

The scope of this project is to replicate the major findings from the paper mentioned above by using *Python* as Data Science language. 
Additionally, I will try to test for overrepresentation within the sample using *Bootstrap* techniques.  

**Already done:**
-	Set up class room
-	Summarize paper findings
-	Prepare causal graph Tex
-	Get in touch with the data
-	Begin computing the summary stat tables 

**To Do:**
- Get Travis CI for reproducibility
-	Compute p-values to compare groups
-	Finish summary stats
-	Begin replication of main results
-	Apply bootstrap/ resampling to test for overrepresentation
-	Check causal graph and identification
