# Student-Project by Fabian Balensiefer
## Replication Study: *"Are Credit Markets Still Local? Evidence from Bank Branch Closings"* by Hoai-Luu Q. Nguzen

The scope of this project is to replicate the major findings from the paper mentioned above by using *Python* as Data Science tool.
Additionally, I will try to test for overrepresentation within the sample using *Resampling* techniques.  

**Already done:**
-	Set up class room
-	Summarize paper findings
-	Prepare causal graph Tex
-	Get in touch with the data
-	Reproducing summary stats
- Replication of Figures and Main regression-tables (work in progress)

**To Do:**
- Finish work on table 7!
-	Why are the estimates in table 6 different?
- Check how to put SE in brackets below
- Implement 2SLS-IV and check generated POST-Variables
- Why does the normalized Figures look different?
-	Apply bootstrap/ resampling to test for overrepresentation
-	Check causal graph and identification
